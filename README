Software to read a PT100 temperature sensor mounted
on the chip of a cryocamera.
In the script 'cryocamera.py' you can define the
temerature at which the cryocamera should be operated.
If the actual temperature is lower than this defined
temperature, one of the GPIO pins will apply 3.3V to
a FET which then will allow a current from the
Raspberry Pi power supply to flow through a resistor
chain within the camera case to heat it up.

To run the cryocamera, you need to install motion:
sudo apt-get install motion

copy the file motion.conf to /etc/motion/motion.conf.bak
streaming port is defined as 8081.

To start/stop motion:
sudo motion start
sudo service motion stop

NOTE:
The camera is heating up when acquiring images.
Since the thermal insulation is quite good,
